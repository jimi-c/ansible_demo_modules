module: ab
version_added: 2.never
short_description: Use the ab command line utility to test a website's response time
description:
  - "This module use the C(ab) (apache bench) CLI utility to load test a target URL.
    From the C(ab) man page:"
  - "C(ab) is a tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    server. It is designed to give you an impression of how your current Apache
    installation performs."
  - "This especially shows you how many requests per second your Apache installation
    is capable of serving."

options:
  uri:
    description:
      - "The target URI to test."
    required: yes
  reqeust_count:
    description:
      - "The number of requests to send to the C(uri)."
    required: no
    default: 1000
  workers:
    description:
      - "The number of concurrent workers to use for sending requests."
    required: no
    default: 5
  keepalive:
    description:
      - "A boolean value, which when set tells C(ab) to use the HTTP KeepAlive feature."
    required: no
    default: no
  variable_length:
    description:
      - "A boolean value, which when set tells C(ab) to accept variable-length responses."
      - "When disabled, any differences in bytes returned from the first response C(ab) 
        receives is marked as an error in the report."
    required: no
    default: no

requirements:
  - BeautifulSoup
  - ab (apache bench CLI utility)

notes:
  - Please be aware that a large number of concurrent workers can overwhelm either the
    webserver, the host on which the module is executing, or both. Use with caution only
    on webservers you control.
