description:
  - "A simple utility to make repeated calls to a web server at the specified URI."

options:
  uri:
    description:
      - "The target URI to test."
    required: yes
  reqeust_count:
    description:
      - "The number of requests to send to the C(uri)."
    required: no
    default: 1000
  workers:
    description:
      - "The number of concurrent workers to use for sending requests."
    required: no
    default: 5
  keepalive:
    description:
      - "A boolean value, which when set tells the module to use the HTTP KeepAlive feature."
    required: no
    default: no
  variable_length:
    description:
      - "A boolean value, which when set tells the module to accept variable-length responses."
      - "When disabled, any differences in bytes returned from the first response C(ab) 
        receives is marked as an error in the report."
    required: no
    default: no

requirements: [] # <- NO REQUIREMENTS!

notes:
  - Please be aware that a large number of concurrent workers can overwhelm either the
    webserver, the host on which the module is executing, or both. Use with caution only
    on webservers you control.
